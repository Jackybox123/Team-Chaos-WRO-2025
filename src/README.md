Control software
====
Python Language: The primary programming language used to develop the control software. Python's simplicity and extensive libraries make it ideal for interfacing with hardware components, processing data, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used to develop and train AI models. TensorFlow allows for the implementation of neural networks that enable the AI RC Car to recognize objects, make decisions, and navigate autonomously.

PuTTY: A terminal emulator used to connect to the Raspberry Pi remotely. With PuTTY, developers can access the Raspberry Pi's command line interface over SSH, allowing for configuration, debugging, and deployment of software updates without needing a direct physical connection.

Pi Camera: The camera module connected to the Raspberry Pi, used for capturing real-time video and images. The Pi Camera is integral to the AI RC Car's vision system, allowing it to process visual data for object detection, line tracking, and environmental awareness. The camera feeds data into the TensorFlow models for real-time processing.

Calibrate: A function or process within the software used to adjust and fine-tune the sensors and motors to ensure accurate readings and movements. Calibration is essential for the car to operate correctly, as it ensures that sensors provide reliable data and motors respond accurately to control signals.

Config: A configuration module or file that stores settings and parameters for the AI RC Car. This includes sensor thresholds, motor speed limits, and neural network hyperparameters. The config module allows for easy adjustments and fine-tuning of the system.

Manage: A management module that oversees the overall operation of the AI RC Car. This includes starting and stopping the car, monitoring system health, and handling communication between different software components. The management module ensures that all parts of the system work together seamlessly.

myconfig: A custom configuration file or module where user-specific settings and preferences are stored. This allows for personalization and customization of the AI RC Car's behavior to suit different environments or user requirements.

Train: A training module that uses TensorFlow to develop and refine the AI models. The train module processes training data, adjusts model parameters, and evaluates performance to improve the car's ability to navigate and make decisions. Training is an iterative process that enhances the car's autonomy and intelligence.

Workflow
Configuration: Using the config and myconfig modules, developers set up the initial parameters and settings for the car, tailoring it to the specific environment and requirements.

Calibration: Sensors and motors are calibrated to ensure accurate data collection and response. This step is crucial for reliable operation.

Training: AI models are trained using TensorFlow. The train module processes data and updates the models to enhance the car's performance.

Deployment: Using PuTTY, the control software is deployed to the Raspberry Pi. Developers can remotely manage and update the software as needed.

Operation: The management module coordinates the car's activities, ensuring that the AI models, sensors, and motors work together to achieve autonomous navigation.
